# The NCHLT BNF extractor

I followed the Babel BNF extractor recipe as closely as I could.

The NN architecture currently used in the Babel recipe is TDNN, which is what I used here.
We want to experiment with TDNN-F too, but this has to be implemented still.

Extractors with BN dimensions of 39, 80 and 120 have been trained on the training set data of the nine Bantu langauges in the NCHLT corpora.
